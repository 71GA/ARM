ARM
===

This is the repository for helping programmers to program ARM microcontrollers on Linux (Arch Linux is being used). In the repository you will find:
  
  (a)   instalation scripts for toolchain arm none-eabi and supplementary software (dfu-util, unsimgcr) to prepare
        programs for ARM9 microcontrollers (LPC3141), 
  (b)   buildsystems (make) set up for cross-compilation for LPC3141,
  (c)   basic C examples for LPC3141, 
  (d)   scripts to upload binaries to LPC3141 via USB/SSD.

What Is currently under developpment:

  (a)   Cmake build system, 
  (b)   basic C examples for ADC, UART,
  (c)   on chip debugging through JTAG.
